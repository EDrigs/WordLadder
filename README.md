# Word Ladder

Word Ladder is a game created by Lewis Carol in which two words are given, a starting word and an end word. The player must find a chain of other words to link the two. The two adjacent words must differ by one letter.

## Implementation

The implementation utilizes custom `Stack` and `Queue` classes to store needed words to process the shortest possible ladder.

## How to Use:

The `resources` folder found in the project contains `dictionary.txt` that holds possible words to be used for the ladder. The program reads `input.txt`
and utilizes the first and second word on each line as the starting and ending word, respectively.
